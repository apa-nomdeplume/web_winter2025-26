    <p class="image-caption">This is a painting by John Jude Palencar of the dragon Saphira. She is the dragon of Eragon, and currently the last female dragon of her race.</p>

This is a painting by John Jude Palencar of the dragon Saphira. It is the cover art for the first book of the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i>, which is titled <i>Eragon</i>. She is Eragon's dragon, and currently is the last female dragon of her race. She and Eragon spend the entirety of the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i> working to defeat Galbatorix, the evil king of Alagaësia. Eragon and Saphira continue on to be the teachers of the next generation of Dragon Riders, leaving Alagaësia never to return again.

This is a painting by John Jude Palencar of the dragon Thorn. It is the cover art for the second book of the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i>, which is titled <i>Eldest</i>. He is Murtagh's dragon. He and Murtagh spend most of the series in Galbatorix's service (unwillingly), although they end up helping Eragon and Saphira defeat him in the end of the series.

This is a painting by John Jude Palencar of the dragon Glaedr. It is the cover art for the third book of the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i>, which is titled <i>Brisingr</i>. He is Oromis's dragon. He and Oromis are the last of the Old Ones, the elder Riders, most of whom perished during Galbatorix's struggle to reign. Glaedr and Oromis teach and mentor Eragon when he goes to Ellesméra (the elven capitol) to learn and study. They are both killed in the battle at Gil'ead (a human city) by Thorn and Murtagh, although Glaedr's consciousness lives on in his Eldunarí, or his "heart of hearts".

This is a painting by John Jude Palencar of the dragon Fírnen. It is the cover art for the fourth and last book of the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i>, which is titled <i>Inheritance</i>. He is Arya's dragon. He hatches after the defeat of Galbatorix while Arya is taking him to Ellesméra. Fírnen mated with Saphira soon after the demise of Galbatorix, although that soon ended when Saphira and Eragon left Alagaësia. Arya is now the elven queen, and Fírnen stays by her side.
