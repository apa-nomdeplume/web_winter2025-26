    <br><br><h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time, the Ancient Language was the language of all beings in Alagaësia. Later, it was only used by the elves and some 
                <br>humans, and, in one instance, by dwarves. The language is the tongue of the Grey Folk, the beings who settled in Alagaësia after the 
                <br>dragons and dwarves (native to the land). The elves and humans settled in the same area where the Grey Folk had initially done a 
                <br>few centuries later. 
                <br><br>After a tragic accident killed almost all the beings in Alagaesia, the Grey Folk managed to link the ancient language to magic (it is 
                <br>unknown how). The ancient language was now also used to command and regulate magic. Acts of magic were linked to specific 
                <br>words; the more words in the ancient language a spellcaster knew, the more magic they could perform. It was also possible to 
                <br>manipulate magic using non-verbal spells, but it was extremely dangerous, as, if the mind wandered, the spell would change.
                <br><br>It is impossible to lie in the ancient language, as words spoken in the language are undoubtedly true. However, the elves are known 
                <br>to be excellent at saying one thing while meaning another. Because of the honesty necessary to speak the language, the ancient 
                <br>language is used for oaths of allegiance, which would ensure that they would not be broken, although it is possible to get around 
                <br>them if the oath's wording has loopholes. However, it's possible to say something untrue if the person saying it believes it to be true.
                <br><br>Names in the ancient language are called "true names", and the knowledge of such a name is a source of great power and control. 
                <br>The same is true of the ancient language itself: the knowledge of the name of the ancient language allows one to change the meaning 
                <br>of the words in the language. The name of the ancient language was discovered by Galbatorix and is now known solely by Murtagh, 
                <br>Eragon, and Arya.
