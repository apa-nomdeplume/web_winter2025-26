                    Once upon a time, the Ancient Language was the language of all beings in Alagaësia. Later, it was only used by the elves and some humans, and, in one instance, by dwarves. The language is the tongue of the Grey Folk, the beings who settled in Alagaësia after the dragons and dwarves (both are native to the land of Alagaësia). The elves and humans settled in the same area where the Grey Folk had initially done a few centuries later.<br><br>After a tragic magic-related accident killed almost all the beings in Alagaesia, the Grey Folk managed to link the ancient language to magic (it is unknown how). The ancient language was now also used to command and regulate magic. Acts of magic were linked to specific words; the more words in the ancient language a spellcaster knew, the more magic they could perform. It was also possible to manipulate magic using non-verbal spells, but it was extremely dangerous, as, if the mind wandered, the spell would change.<br><br>It is impossible to lie in the ancient language, as words spoken in the language are undoubtedly true. However, the elves are known to be excellent at saying one thing while meaning another. Because of the honesty necessary to speak the language, the ancient language is used for oaths of allegiance, which would ensure that they would not be broken, although it is possible to get around them if the oath's wording has loopholes. However, it's possible to say something untrue if the person saying it believes it to be true.<br><br>Names in the ancient language are called "true names", and the knowledge of such a name is a source of great power and control. The same is true of the ancient language itself: the knowledge of the name of the ancient language allows one to change the meaning of the words in the language. The name of the ancient language was discovered by Galbatorix and is now known solely by Murtagh, Eragon, and Arya.
