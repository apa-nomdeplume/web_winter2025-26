                    "Elves were a race of beings who migrated to Alagaësia from Alalëa in the distant past: around 5217 AC, known for their wisdom and great skill with magic, among other things."

                <br><br><h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>
                    Although humanoid in appearance, elves have noticeably angular features, slanted eyebrows, and pointed ears, as well as thin angular faces. They are generally tall and slim. According to legend, they are the fairest people of the land, partly because of the physical transformation caused by the dragons' influence on them (and are thus known as the Fair Folk).<br><br>Most elves are more gifted with magic than the other races and have an innate knowledge of their true names, thus giving them a great deal more power compared to the other races of Alagaësia. Elves are also known to be highly intelligent and wise, which is perhaps due to their long lives, or possibly by their union with the dragons.
