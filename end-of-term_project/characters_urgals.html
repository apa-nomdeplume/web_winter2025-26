                    "The Urgals (or Urgralgra in their language) are a race of sentient creatures that inhabit Alagaësia. In the first book they had been forced by Durza into the service of Galbatorix. They are considered evil by most humans, but are not inherently so. Though most are uneducated in the normal definition of the word, they make up for this with brute strength, as well as exceptional combat and command skills. They were used as expendable "shock troops" by Galbatorix's army. The Urgal language is simple and guttural. Only a few phrases are known to outsiders and most of those are related to war and combat. Angela, the herbalist, is one of few who can speak their language. As with other races, they are capable of using Magic, to the ignorance of both humans and dwarves. With the fall of the Broddring Empire the Urgals swore loyalty to Nasuada as High Queen and were made Dragon Riders along with the Dwarves."
